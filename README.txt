About
-----

This is a README for the nmap-exp/gyani directory. The directory contains
projects started by Gyanendra "gyani" Mishra and the goal of this document
is to document all the directories ever started here, with their current status
and contents.

This file is a table of contents for my directories and
documents the most important things about them:

1. Goal of the folder
2. Origin of the folder (for diff-ing purposes)
3. The status of the folder
4. (optional) any features you might find useful that got dropped

This is inpsired from nmap-exp/d33tah/README.txt. Liked how thorough
it is.
